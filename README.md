# Overview
## Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the BizWizV2.1 Enhanced system, a multi-city commercial location analysis platform designed for data-driven site selection decisions. The system uses machine learning to analyze potential restaurant locations by integrating demographic, geographic, and competitive data across multiple configured cities.

## System Purpose
BizWizV2.1 is a commercial location intelligence platform that predicts optimal restaurant placement using multi-source data integration and machine learning. The system currently focuses on Raising Cane's expansion opportunities in North Dakota markets, analyzing factors including:
- Demographics: Income, age, and population density from US Census data
- Competition: Distance and density of competing fast-food establishments
- Commercial Viability: Traffic patterns, zoning compliance, and accessibility
- Market Factors: City-specific preferences and saturation levels
The platform generates interactive visualizations, revenue predictions, and ranked location recommendations to support strategic expansion decisions.

## System Architecture
The BizWizV2.1 system follows a modular architecture with distinct layers for orchestration, configuration, data processing, and visualization:

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No processed data found"**
```bash
# Run data collection first
python enhanced_data_collection.py --city grand_forks_nd
```

**"API quota exceeded"**
```bash
# Check daily usage
cat cache_*/api_usage.json
# Wait 24 hours or upgrade API plan
```

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
python install.py
# Or manually: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"No city configuration found"**
```bash
# Check available cities
python enhanced_data_collection.py --list-cities
# Verify city_configs.yaml exists
```

### Performance Optimization

**Slow data collection:**
- Use cached data when possible
- Reduce grid spacing in city_config.py
- Implement API rate limiting

**Memory issues:**
- Process cities individually
- Clear cache between runs
- Reduce feature set for large datasets

## 🔄 Migration from V1

### Automatic Migration
The enhanced system is backward compatible. Your existing `.env` file and cached data will work, but you'll get additional features by using the new scripts.

### Manual Migration Steps
1. **Backup existing data**: Copy your `processed_location_data.pkl`
2. **Install new dependencies**: Run `python install.py`
3. **Configure cities**: The system will auto-create `city_configs.yaml`
4. **Re-run analysis**: Use `enhanced_data_collection.py` for better results

### What's Preserved
- ✅ API keys and configuration
- ✅ Cached Google Maps data
- ✅ Core analysis methodology
- ✅ Visualization preferences

### What's Enhanced
- 🔄 Better caching system
- 🔄 Real zoning data
- 🔄 Model validation
- 🔄 Multi-city support

## 📈 Future Roadmap

### Version 2.2 (Planned)
- **Advanced Geospatial Analysis**: Drive-time polygons and visibility analysis
- **Financial Modeling**: ROI calculations and lease cost integration
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Market share analysis and pricing models
- **API Expansion**: Additional data sources and real-time updates

### Version 2.3 (Planned)
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS/Azure hosting with web interface
- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user support and shared analysis
- **Advanced Reporting**: PDF generation and executive dashboards
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning models and time-series forecasting
